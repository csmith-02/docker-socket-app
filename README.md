## DOCKER SOCKETS APP
I made this simple sockets app in which a person can receive and/or send a message. The purpose of this app was to experiment using Docker to deploy individual containers using
Dockerfile as well as deploying the containers as 1 "package" within their own network space using docker compose.

To test this app, I opened the app in one tab and selected send a message. Then in another duplicate tab, I selected receive a message. After typing and submitting a message, the
message could be viewed in the receive-a-message tab.
